 <title>Introduction</title>
 
 <para>This book is an attempt to fill the gap in the information available on
  the craft of Software Build Management. There are of course plenty of documentation 
  on particular builds tools as well as information on how to resolve particular problems
  of these tools. Of course there is no need to undervalue this sort of resources.</para>

 <para>Sometimes, however, a different perspective is wanted. When one decides to create a build
  and component management infrastructure, often the first thing needed is a good problem domain
  analyzes. As there are many tools exist destined to solve the same problem, it is beneficial 
  to define the problem and desired solution in a tool-independent way and only then to choose 
  most appropriate concrete solution.
</para>

<para>This books uses this approach. First we will explore the problem domain and provide necessary
definitions. Then we will define what components composes build and component management system. Finally
we will state qualities a good build management system have to possess.</para> 

<para>On that theoretical foundation we will learn how to build a practical system. We will investigate
existing build tools, seeing how does particular tool fits into the general blueprint of a build management 
system and how much of the theoretical requirements we have defined it fulfills.</para>

<para>Real world build management system case study concludes this book, so that reader may see what
sort of problems arises in the real life and how theory corresponds with the practice.</para>
